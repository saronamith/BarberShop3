# BarberShop3

Aaron Smith - 20068636

My project is a Barber Shop application where it gives the user the functionality to signing in and registering their details,
It also gives the user the option to make an appointment and save those details via the application.

//Noteworthy Problem

The application was working perfectly at one stage but then once i started adding an SQLite Database, i started getting different 
errors across the application, My application began stopping when clicking differfent functions. This copy is not the finished product
I want to vastly improve on this as i believe i have tried too many procedures all at once and have became overwhelemed by errors

//Persistance

In this version of my application i have shared preferences set up for when a user logs in, i then went on to create a databse through 
SQLite for my Appointments, in the next version of my app i want to have a fully functioning database for appointments and user 
details, 

//Git Approach

I was constantly uploading my project to Github on a regular basis, i found this quite helpful as it kept track of the different versions
of my application that were at different stages of the development process.

//UX Approach

My overall design of the application was to keep it quite minimal, The problems i faced were i was trying to add complicated code,
i wanted a carousel image viewer that showed a images in a sort of timer preview but found this quite difficult, i hope to implement this 
in the next version of my app
